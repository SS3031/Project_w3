Working for an NGO
This dataset contains information of the schools in India segregated based of districts across the country.
I will try to use this dataset to identify the literacy and drop out rates of kids in India.

1. imported the dataset
2. there is another meta data with details of the columns names
3. adjusted width of column using "pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)" to view maximum content of the column
